The world is changing, that is natural. What is not natural is the world's inhabinants speeding it up. 
We've never done this before. In the Ice Age, we lived, but we did not have the temptation to grow, to develop, to gain. Sure, modern 
medicine is a miracle (we can keep that), and cars speed up the day, but do we really need video games and TV? Do we need to cut down 
forests and drill holes in the earth just to have what we have always had? For centuries now, people have want something else besides
money, comfort, and life. They want fame. And if you have to sacrifice your private life and lives for it, you will still do it.
